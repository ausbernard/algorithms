## All solutions are coded by me.

problems:
1. Simple, nearly no assistance
2. Fair, wording of the problem was unclear. 
3. Hard, Personally... I don't feel I fully understand Rho's algorithm programtically - would like to swing back. Fascinating learning the time complexity of Î¸ $\sqrt{n}$ for Rho.
4. Simple, this one was fun. Used an algorithm information website to teach me more about recursion. Really helped me frame my approach. Felt frustrated after the last problem. So it felt nice to get a win - even if small. *Positive Note:* my algorithm performed slightly more efficient than other (top liked) submissions on the site.
5. Simple, slow af. I will personally make this more efficient.
6.
7.
8. 
9. Couldn't solve it - YET. going to keep doing it until I get it right
