I'm game to do 60 problems Amazon.

probs:
1. Simple, nearly no assistance
2. Fair, wording of the problem was unclear. Watched youtube videos on the following concepts - backward sequencing.
3. Hard, for this 1 & 2 were cake walks. Want to follow up with going back and learning more about Rho's algorithm and it's use of `modulo` and `tortiose/hare` shift. Fascinating learning the time complexity of theta-sqrt(n).
