I'm game to do 60 problems Amazon.

probs:
1. Simple, nearly no assistance
2. Fair, wording of the problem was unclear. Watched youtube videos on the following concepts - backward sequencing.
3. Hard, for this 1 & 2 were cake walks. Want to follow up with going back and learning more about Rho's algorithm and it's use of `modulo` and `tortiose/hare` shift. Fascinating learning the time complexity of theta-sqrt(n) for Rho.
4. Simple, this one was fun. Used an algorithm information website to teach me more about recursion and how to approach this problem. Felt frustrated after last problem so was good to come back with a small win - even if that win was simple. My algorithm performed slightly faster than other (top liked) submissions on the site.
