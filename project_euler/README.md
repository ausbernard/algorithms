I'm game to do 60 problems Amazon.

probs:
1. Simple, nearly no assistance
2. Fair, wording of the problem was unclear. Personally, I don't feel I fully understand Rho's algorithm programtically - would like to swing back. Fascinating learning the time complexity of Î¸ $\sqrt{n}$ for Rho.
4. Simple, this one was fun. Used an algorithm information website to teach me more about recursion and how to approach this problem. Felt frustrated after last problem so was good to come back with a small win - even if that win was simple. My algorithm performed slightly faster than other (top liked) submissions on the site.
