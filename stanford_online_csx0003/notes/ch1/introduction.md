# Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1

## Introduction
Talking about an algorithm (well designed set of rules) you would use the following pattern:
1. Define a computational problem
2. We will say what the input is
3. We will then say what the desired output is
4. Then we will proceed to give a solution (algorithm) that transforms the input to the output
5. We will assess the performance of this algorithm through number of basic operations that it performs

### The Grade-School Algorithm
#### Integer Multiplication

Input: 2 n-digit numbers (x and y). Where n is large (> 1000)
Output: the product x * y
Algorithm: see integer_multiplication.py
Performance: Primitive opeprations (add or multiply 2 single-digit numbers) count is =
